# powershell
PowerShell scripts I use.

---

[apple-crap-destroyer](apple-crap-destroyer.ps1)  
This script is used to tidy Apple-sidecar infested USB sticks.

[sort-files-into-folder](sort-files-into-folder.ps1)  
Used to segregate RAW and jpeg files in a fast manner.

[stop-vmware-services](stop-vmware-services.ps1)  
VMWare blocks a lot of stuff from happening, so if you want to start a local server that's a common thing not possible anymore, if any of their services is running.
