# powershell
PowerShell scripts I use.

---

- [apple-crap-destroyer](apple-crap-destroyer.ps1)  
This script is used to clean up infested USB sticks from those pesky Apple-sidecar files (like "`.DS_Store`").

- [deaspect-dng](deaspect-dng.ps1)  
If you accidentally set your camera to pre-crop your files you can revert that on a whole folder of DNGs with the help of this script.  
[Needs [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) installed and in your PATH.]

- [sort-files-into-folder](sort-files-into-folder.ps1)  
Used to segregate RAW and jpeg files in a fast manner.

- [stop-vmware-services](stop-vmware-services.ps1)  
VMWare blocks a lot of stuff from happening. You want to start a local server? Yeah, that's commonly not possible anymore if any of their services is running.
